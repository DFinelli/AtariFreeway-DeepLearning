# Artificial Intelligence: Reinforcment Learning

Academic project (Fall 2019) to explore an AI concept.

I chose to research and implement an reinforcement learning agent to play an Atari game. Using OpenAI Gym, https://gym.openai.com/

Research included trying self-built implementations of model-based reinforcement learning and then Approximate Q learning. In the end, it was determined a more complex solution was needed. This resulted in using Deep Q Learning and Double Deep Q Learning. See project analysis in Analysis.pdf. 

The Double Deep Q implementation was built using the source code and tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-tutorial-with-open-ai-gym-c0de4471f368
